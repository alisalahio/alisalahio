Google feels like your easy-going friend you meet everyday. Being close makes you know their weaknesses, but you get to accept it because you like their company.

Apple feels like your good-looking super-successful friend you're secretly attracted to. They're so busy though, so you only meet once a year.

This article answers why do they feel this way?! It's all about design and brand.

# Design
Both Apple and Google lean towards simple and minimal design. However, their intent for doing this is very different. 

Google's simple design:
- Put main functionality at center
- No bullshit unneeded things.
- Make it easy to use.

Apple's simple design: 
- It should look elegant
- Don't add visual clutter
- Get it slimmer and sexier

And these approaches make sense for them as businesses. 

Google makes tools that they want you to "use" everyday. They want it be easy. Don't know how to search? We put a single input at the center of the whole page! No extra stuff = No excuse.

Apple makes products that should attract you to "buy." They need Airpods to be unique status symbols. When you're asked why you use them, you say they just work. It's a good excuse because they actually do!

# Brand
Apple's brand is godly. Google brand is friendly.

At the front of Google's building is fun Android statues. Apple's building is elegant transparent glass.

Google's logo is colorful. Apple's logo is set in stone.

Google is famous to put pointless easter eggs and april fool jokes.
Apple is trend-setting. It's only followed and never follows.

Google uses every social media platform. 
Apple uses YouTube for uploading ads and disables comments. 

This gives rise to interesting outcomes:
You like using a Google products.
You are attracted to buy an Apple product.

When Google stops a product. It's not a big deal. It's like your close friend when they break a promise. 
You'll accept it and remind yourself of the many good things they do.

If Apple breaks a promise. It's a huge public failure. Everyone talks about it! They're this super-successful friend who should never make a mistake.
