As you all know, I'm a superhero. But today I'm sharing with you my secret weakness! You aren't a villain after all, are you?!

My weakness is: I can be easily triggered! Just say something political I slightly disagree with! Dare you say an opinion that I don't fully support. I will be TRIGGERED! I warned ya..

In real life, I try to avoid being triggered and pretend that I don't care. But there is one place that still triggers me! Damn it, you twitter blue bird!

That made me wonder, why does twitter trigger me? Is it a universal conspiracy? Was Jack a super-villain all along?!

So I prepared this list for all my fellow triggerable superheroes out there..

## Twitter is politicized
My grandma always said, don't talk politics and religion. Yeah, she didn't say sex, because you shouldn't even mention it!

Here are some internet facts: Facebook is the home of cats, Reddit is the home of Thanos, and Twitter is the home of Donald Trump!

How can I see a Trump tweet and act cool? I don't follow him, but still see him quote-retweeted!

I'm on twitter -> Trump reaches me -> I get triggered!

## Twitter is fast
One thing I learned from being a superhero: The faster you react, the less you think!

I once killed Batman thinking he was Magneto because it was too dark. I had to act fast before switching the light on! Sorry Batman, being fast has its downsides..

When I see a popuplar tweet, I feel the need to reply asap. Or my reply will be buried with thousands of other replies. And I don't like defeat!

## Tweets are short
That's one thing that makes me think Twitter is a villain hiding behind a cute blue-bird mask! From the start, Twitter had a character limit!

If I'm writing a controversial tweet, chances are I already know some counter-arguments. But I won't bother addressing them in my short tweet. It's not a blog for god's sake!

Plus, writing a short controversial tweet and leaving it like that makes me look more badass!

## Heat brings likes!
I always need to see the love of the crowd to feel worthy. Would you rather like a nice tweet that's just being-nice? Or a badass thug-life tweet? You don't need to answer, because I see it everyday!

(Proof that twitter is bad for superheroes)

Having killed Batman by accident, I'm now careful of judging people as super-villains before I have concrete evidence. So I'm giving Twitter it's chance. But be careful @jack, I'm following you!
